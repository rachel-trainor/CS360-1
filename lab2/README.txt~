Synchronization is used:
	In my Buffer class with append and take which add and remove clients from a queue.

	And in my Server whenever I read from or write to my map which holds users and messages for those users. Specifically I use synchronization in list(), get(), reset(), addToMap(), listResponse() and getResponse()which are all in Server.cpp
